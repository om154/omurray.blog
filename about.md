Hi 👋🏻
My name is Oliver. I'm a Software Engineer 🧑🏼‍💻 from Melbourne, Australia.

Some of my passions revolve around sports, health & fitness, coffee, restaurants, and software development. I am a curious guy, a keen learner, and I always love chatting with anyone who has new ideas or shares these interests!

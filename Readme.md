My personal [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault template. A bottom-up approach to note-taking and organizing things I am interested in. It is in no way dogmatic, just one example of how you can use Obsidian. Take the parts you like and tailor them to your needs.

See the article [How I use Obsidian](https://stephango.com/vault) on my site for a detailed explanation of this vault structure.

Here is a change.
## Get started

1. [Download this vault](https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Unzip the .zip file to a folder of your choosing
3. Open Obsidian and create a new vault pointing to that folder
